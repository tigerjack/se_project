Account
An account is a virtual representation of a User. The System can read and store information about a User by editing their Account.

Battery
A Battery powers a Vehicle. The charge state of the Battery can be anywhere between 0% and 100%, is reduced when the Vehicle is In Use, and increases when the Vehicle is Plugged to a Charging Area.

Banking System
An interface that allows the System to charge the users for a Fee.

Car
An electric car owned by the Car-sharing service, rented to the User and tracked by the System. A Car can be:
- In Use, if a User is driving it
- Available, if it can be Reserved
- Reserved, if it is linked to a User but not yet In Use
- Unavailable if it can't be Reserved (for example due to damage, battery exhaustion etc.)
- Plugged, if its Plug is connected to the Socket of a Charging Area. A Plugged Car is also Available.

Car-sharing
A Car-sharing service allows Users to rent Vehicles for a limited amount of time, being charged a Fee according to time and possibly applying a Discount or an Increase.

Charging Area
A special Parking Area where Vehicles can be Plugged.

Company 
The enterprise that want to built the System to provide a car-sharing services to its Users. It is the main stakeholder.

Database
A structure that holds informations linked logically according to relationships. For instance, a Database could hold records of every registered User, every available Vehicle and every time a User rented a Vehicle.

Discount
A reduction in the Fee to be paid because of good behaviour on the part of the User, e.g. leaving the Vehicle plugged or bringing it back with a mostly-full battery. The actions that constitute good behaviour are determined ad detailed further in the document.

Fee
The amount of money that the User will be charged for his usage of the Car-sharing service, or for making a Reservation that is not used.

GPS
Global Positioning System. A system that allows to precisely know a Vehicle's position.

Increase
An increase in the Fee to be paid because of improper behaviour on the part of the User, e.g. bringing the Vehicle back with a mostly-empty battery.

Management System
An external system that allows administrative access to the internal Database.

Parking Area
A place where the User can leave their Vehicle. Parking Areas are predefined by the System.

Passenger
Someone (either User or not) who travels in a Vehicle rented by a User together with him.

Plug
A part of the Vehicle that interfaces itself with a Socket of a Charging Area. If a Vehicle's Plug is linked to a Charging Area's Socket, the Vehicle is Plugged.

Reservation
A User can make a Reservation in order to link themselves with an Available Vehicle.

Socket
A part of the Charging Area that interfaces itself with the Plug of a Vehicle. If a Vehicle's Plug is linked to a Charging Area's Socket, the Vehicle is Plugged.

System
The automated software structure this document is about.
It tracks Users and Vehicles and deals with all the details needed for Carsharing, from GPS mapping to charging Users with Fees.

User
A person registered on the System, who will use the Vehicles for a Fee.

Visitor
A person who needs to complete the registration in order to become a User.
