A list of the domain assumptions for the project.

- The User can only have one Account at time.
-	After the doors of the cars are unlocked the User always enters the Car and ignites the engine.
-	The Car can detect and count if there’s people in the Car.
- There's an external Company which manages the employees.
-	When the User gets passengers the corresponding discount on the User’s fee will be applied only if the passengers stay in the Car for     more than 3 minutes. In those 3 minutes the Car can be moving or can be standing.
-	As soon as the Car battery status gets below 20% of the full capacity,the Car isn't in a Charging Area, and the Car status isn’t ‘In     
  Use’ or ‘Plugged’, there’s always an employee that immediately reaches the Car and recharges it on-site; in the meanwhile the Car status 
  is 'UnAvailable' until the battery gets full recharged.
- When the Car battery status reaches the 0% of the full capacity the Car will be set as "Unavailable".
- If the Car status is Unavailable, the Car will be reached by an employee to consider if the Car needs to be taken in the Company’s         workshop for repairs or just needs to be recharged.
-	The Car has the ability to detect if it has been damaged. If the Car status is 'In Use' when a 'minor damage' is detected, the Car 
  status will be set to 'Unavailable' after the end of the ride; if a 'major
  damage' is detected the Car status is immediately set to     
  'Unavailable'. In both cases an employee will reach the car, check for the damages,and decide if the Car repairs will be charged to the 
  User. 
- If the Car has been left out of a Parking Area there's will always be an employee. 
-	Every fine received by the Company for improper use of the Car by the User, will be charged to the User's credit card.
-	We trust the data provided by the User during his/her registration on the System.
- A Plugged Car will not be maliciously unplugged.
- The DataBase management in which the Cars, Parking Areas, Charging Areas, Users,etc, are stored is managed by an external Company.
