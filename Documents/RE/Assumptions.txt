A list of the domain assumptions for the project.

- The User can only have one Account at time.
-	We trust the data provided by the User during his/her registration on the System.
- The DataBase management in which the Cars, Parking Areas, Charging Areas, Users,etc, are stored is managed by an external Company.
- There's an external Company which manages the employees.
-	The Car can detect and count if there’s people in the Car.
- After a Car is Plugged, it will not be maliciously unplugged by the User himself/herself or by other people.
- The User always enters the Car when he/she unlocks its doors.
-	After the doors of the cars are unlocked by the User, he/she always enters the Car and ignites the engine.
-	When the User gets passengers the corresponding discount on the User’s fee will be applied only if the passengers stay in the Car for     
  more than 3 minutes. In those 3 minutes the Car can be moving or can be standing.
-	As soon as the Car battery status gets below 20% of the full capacity,the Car isn't in a Charging Area, and the Car status isn’t ‘In     
  Use’ or ‘Plugged’, there’s always an employee that immediately reaches the Car and recharges it on-site; in the meanwhile the Car status 
  is 'UnAvailable' until the battery gets full recharged.
- When the Car battery status reaches the 0% of the full capacity the Car stops working and is immediately set as "Unavailable".
- If the Car status is Unavailable, the Car will be reached by an employee to consider if the Car needs to be taken in the Company’s         workshop for repairs or just needs to be recharged.
-	The Car has the ability to detect if it has been damaged. If the Car status is 'In Use' when a 'minor damage' is detected, the Car 
  status will be set to 'Unavailable' after the end of the ride; if a 'major damage' is detected the Car status is immediately set to     
  'Unavailable'. In both cases an employee will reach the car, check for the damages,decide if the Car got few damages and can still be  
   used by setting it Available and decide if the damages were caused by the User and so if they will be charged to him/her. 
- A car which is "Available" or "Plugged" can be set as "Unavailable" in every moment by an Employee. 
- If the Car has been left out of a Parking Area there's will always be an employee which immediately reaches it, recharges it and move   
  it to a Charging Area. 
-	Every fine received by the Company for improper use of the Car by the User, will be charged to the User.

Il major damage è un danno che non permette alla macchina di camminare.
