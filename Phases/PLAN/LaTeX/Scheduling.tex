For each of the required documents, we have split our tasks between ourselves. For the development of the application, we have separated a few large tasks and split them.

The following Gantt and resource diagrams show how these has been split. We are using the COCOMO-estimated development time, adjusted to reflect how our preliminary work was corresponding to the "Inception" development phase.

The redaction of the Code Inspection document was not part of the PowerEnJoy project, therefore has not been included.
