In the communication diagrams I've omitted the DispatcherServlet, whose only
purpose is to analyze the URL coming from the HttpRequest and dispatch this 
HttpRequest to the appropriate Component (Servlet).
The focus in WebClient and MobileClient is on the end point of the HTTP 
communications.
For the Auth diagram, it is used to show the mechanism of Login/Authentication.
