***	Alloy assumptions
0.	ChargingArea extends ParkingArea!! (in Alloy, it means CA is a subset of PA)
1.	Id codes and emails are not relevant for our Alloy model
4.	ChargingCars and ParkedCars are two disjoint sets. It implies, among other 
	things, that the ParkingCapacity is not necessarily greater than 
	ChargingCapacity. 
5.	Not interested in Visitor in our model
6.	Positions are exact for CompanyArea because they are predefined.
	So we assume that each CompanyArea is defined by a set of GpsPoint denoting
	its area.
	However, in the real world, positions are approximated for Persons and Cars.
	For this reason, we introduced the concept of GpsVolume, consisting of 
	various GpsPoints, and that should be read as "the volume that a Person/Car
	can occupy at a given moment basing on their GPS coordinates".
	Of course, we have can have different Persons and/or Cars in the same
	GpsVolume. 
	To model the fact that persons or cars are nearby we say that they have to
	share at least one GpsPoint. So if a Person is inside a Car he/she should
	have some GpsPoint in common with it; the same concept applies for Cars 
	inside CompanyAreas.
  	
*** Project assumptions
**	Trasversal
1.	GPS Positions of Areas are predefined and do not overlap
2.	Cars can be in the positions of an area but not parked/charging only if they
	are in use
3.	Minutes are rounded up (if a user has driven for 30 seconds it gets rounded
	up to 1 minute) 

**	Cars
1.	A car may be minor damaged but still available.
2.	We have one kind of Plug, one kind of Socket, one kind of Battery and we are
	not interested in none of them.
3.	Users can reserve only Available cars and no others. 
4.	An "Available" or "Plugged" car can always be set to Unavailable by an 
    Employee or directly by the System, despite the fact that its battery 
    is below 20% or it has a serious damage. 
    In other words Unavailable not implies always a SeriousDamage or LowBattery,
    but also other choices from the Company (f.e. maintenance, we don't know)
	

**	Areas
1.	There is one parking area or charging area at a given position.
2.	Cars in a ParkingSlot can be Available, Reserved or Unavailable.
	Cars in a ChargingSlot should be PluggedOn.
3.	All ParkingAreas (excluding ChargingArea) have a parkingCapacity > 0.
7.	All ChargingAreas have a chargingCapacity > 0, but the parkingCapacity can
	also be 0.
7.	CarState = InUse implies that a Car can't be in a Parking/ChargingSlot. 
8.	The company has at least 1 ChargingArea (eitherwise we can't have discount
	and so on) and at least 1 Car.
