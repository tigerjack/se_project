\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This document presents the requirements of the \emph{PowerEnJoy} system, aimed at powering a car-sharing service. Said requirements will be presented using both natural language and diagrams.
\subsection{Intended Audience}
This document is addressed to all the stakeholders in the \emph{PowerEnJoy} project. This includes, but is not limited to, the CEO, the end users, the development committee, product designers and engineers, quality assurance and marketing.
\subsection{Product Scope}
The \emph{PowerEnJoy} is a partially automated electric car-sharing service. The system keeps track of users and Cars, addresses users to available cars, locks cars when not in use, and charges the users for use and abuse of the Cars. The system also needs to keep track of the battery level of the Cars and dispatch personnel to connect low-on-battery Cars to the power grid.

It is important to notice that this document only describes the requirements for the software dealing with the cars, not the hardware on which the software will run or the management system.
\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations}
\subsubsection{Business terms glossary}
[OBSOLETE: REFER TO GLOSSARY.TXT, THIS WILL BE UPDATED LATER]
\paragraph{Car-sharing}
A \emph{Car-sharing} service allows \emph{Users} to rent \emph{Cars} for a limited amount of time, being charged a \emph{Fee} according to time and possibly applying a \emph{Discount} or an \emph{Increase}.
\paragraph{Database}
A structure that holds informations linked logically according to relationships. For instance, a \emph{Database} could hold records of every registered \emph{User}, every available \emph{Car} and every time a \emph{User} rented a \emph{Car}.
\paragraph{Discount}
A reduction in the \emph{Fee} to be paid because of good behaviour on the part of the \emph{User}, e.g. leaving the \emph{Car} plugged or bringing it back with a mostly-full battery. The actions that constitute good behaviour are determined ad detailed further in the document. [ADD A REFERENCE WHEN YOU MAKE THE SECTION]
\paragraph{Fee}
The amount of money that the \emph{User} will be charged for his usage of the \emph{Car-sharing} service.
\paragraph{Increase}
An increase in the \emph{Fee} to be paid because of improper behavious on the part of the \emph{User}, e.g. bringing the \emph{Car} back with a mostly-empty battery.
\paragraph{Management System}
An external system that allows administrative access to the internal \emph{Database}.
\paragraph{System}
The automated software structure this document is about. It tracks \emph{Users} and \emph{Cars} and deals with all the details needed for \emph{Car-sharing}, from GPS mapping to charging \emph{Users} with \emph{Fees}.
\paragraph{User}
A person registered on the \emph{System}, who will use the \emph{Cars} for a \emph{Fee}.
\paragraph{Car}
An electric car owned by the \emph{Car-sharing} service, rented to the \emph{User} and tracked by the \emph{System}.

\subsubsection{Document specific terms}
\paragraph{Alloy}
A descriptive language that allows to describe a set of structures through constraints.
\paragraph{DBMS}
Data Base Management System. A software interface allowing to interact with the \emph{Database}.
\paragraph{RASD}
Requirements Analysis and Specification Document. This document, describing the \emph{System} to be developed.
\paragraph{UC}
Use Case. A description of interaction between \emph{Users} and \emph{System}.
\paragraph{UML}
