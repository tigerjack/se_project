		\item The \emph{System} runs an algorithm which takes in consideration the distribution of the Cars in the city, the final destination of the \emph{User} and the availability of power plugs in the \emph{Charging Areas}.
		\item The \emph{System} will present the result to the \emph{User}, displaying the address of the \emph{Charging Area}.
	\end{enumerate}	 \\ \hline
	\textbf{Post Conditions} & The \emph{User} can now decide if the proposed \emph{Charging Area} is suitable for their needs. Note that, even if the \emph{User} chooses this \emph{Charging Area}, he/she will still have to plug the \emph{Car} into a Socket of this area in order to get a discount.
	\\ \hline
	\textbf{Exceptions} & If the \emph{Socket} of the \emph{Charging Area} has no more available plugs while the \emph{User} is driving to reach it, the \emph{System} informs the \emph{User} and the Flow of Events starts from point 1.\\ \hline
