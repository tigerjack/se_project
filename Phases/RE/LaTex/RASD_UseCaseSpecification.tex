		\item The \emph{System} computes an algorithm which takes in consideration the distribution of the Cars in the city, the final destination of the \emph{User} and the availability of power plugs in the \emph{Charging Areas}.
	\end{enumerate}	 \\ \hline
	\textbf{Post Conditions} &  The result of this algorithm will be sent to the \emph{User}, providing him the address of the \emph{Charging Area} where to leave the \emph{Car}. The \emph{User} will still have to plug the \emph{Car} in order to get a discount.
	\\ \hline
	\textbf{Exceptions} & If the \emph{Socket} of the \emph{Charging Area} has no more available plugs while the \emph{User} is driving to reach it, the \emph{System} informs the \emph{User} and the Flow of Events starts from point 1.\\ \hline
