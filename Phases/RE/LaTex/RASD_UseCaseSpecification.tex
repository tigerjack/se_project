7b The User did plug the Car (UC13), the battery status is higher than or equal to 20%, he/she didn?t or did take at least 2 passengers with him for at least 3 minutes (UC11), hence the System applies a 30% discount on the fee of the last ride and communicates to the Banking System the fee which will be charged to the User.
7c The User did plug the Car (UC13), the battery status is lower than 20%, he/she didn?t or did take at least 2 passengers with him for at least 3 minutes (UC11), didn?t plug the Car (UC13), hence the System doesn?t apply any discount or surcharge on the fee of the last ride and communicates to the Banking System the fee which will be charged to the User.
