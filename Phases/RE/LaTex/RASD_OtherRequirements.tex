\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
The interfaces the system should interact with.

\subsubsection{Software Interface}
%TODO I would avoid to include here the interfaces of the base software (operating system, web server, etc) for your system. Focus instead on the external software your system is going to interact with (e.g., the payment gateway you mentioned)
\subsubsection{Hardware Interface}
The central server must be provided with one or more sufficiently advanced computers that may run the server-side application, and allow it access to a high-speed network connection.

The client application must be developed so as to have access to both the phone's network connection and its GPS locator.

\subsubsection{User Interface}
The User Interface is provided by the client smartphone application, and allows the user to perform all of their actions.

\subsubsection{Communication Interface}
As mentioned above, the System heavily uses Internet communications protocols, mainly the HTTP protocol. HTTP requests to and from the server will be mostly carried by mobile network connections.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsection{Software System Attributes}
The System does not need to interface with external software. Database management can be performed via the Administrative Access function.
