***String
Don't know why, but if you use a
	var: one String
inside a signature Alloy doesn't generate instances of the model.

***Int
From experience, it seems that the number of generated integers is also bounded to the number of entities specified in the `run` function.
F.e. if you use
	run show() for 5
it generates a range of 2^5 - 1 integers.
It is important because with a small range some constraints can fail.
F.e. if you have a costraint
	number > 100
used with
	run show() for 3
Alloy doesn't generate any model at all.

If you want a greater number of generated integers, you have to specify it with 
	run X for 5 but 7 Int
where 7 specifies the integer bitwidth.
Also, you can't specify a bitwidth greater than 30.
Dafault bitwidth is 4.

***Show
pred show() {
	#ReservationData > 0
	#DrivingData > 0
	#Car = 6 //!!
}
run show for 4

Doens't produce any instance at all (bcz 4 < 6)
