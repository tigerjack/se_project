***	Alloy assumptions
0.	ChargingArea extends ParkingArea!! (in Alloy, it means CA is a subset of PA)
1.	All Int are fake (to say so) bcz when we run the model we generates only a
	small amount of integers. However, this model is consistent.	
2.	Id codes and emails are not relevant for our Alloy model
3.	Not interested in Plugs or Socket type bcz we assume only one kind of 
	Plug/Socket connector. Not interested in batteries neither, but we use them
	bcz it helps to have them in the Visualizer.
4.	ChargingCars and ParkedCars are two disjoint sets. It implies, among other 
	things, that the ParkingCapacity is not necessarily greater than 
	ChargingCapacity. CONTINUO A PENSARE CHE BISOGNI CAMBIARE IL NOME DI "PARKED CARS", E' TROPPO MISLEADING
5.	
  	
*** Project assumptions
**	Trasversal
2.	Minutes are rounded up (if a user has driven for 30 seconds it gets rounded
	up to 1 minute) 

**	Cars
1.	A car may be minor damaged but still available (the  employee has manually 
	set the status to available again) ??
2.	We have one kind of Plug, one kind of Socket.
3.	Users can reserve Plugged and Available cars and no others. NON E' IMPLICITO NEI REQUISITI?
4.	A car can always be set to Unavailable by an Employee or the System, despite 
	the fact that its battery is below 20% or it has a serious damage. In other
	words Unavailable not implies always a SeriousDamage or battery below 20%,
	but also other choices from the Company (f.e. maintenance, we don't know)
	SE LA MACCHINA E' IN USO NON POSSIAMO METTERLA AVAILABLE O IL POVERINO SI RITROVA IN MEZZO ALL'AUTOSTRADA FERMO :D
	

**	Areas
1.	There is one parking area or charging area at a given address
2.	Cars in a Parking Area can be Available, Reserved or Unavailable.
	Cars in a Charging Area can also be Plugged.
6.	All ParkingAreas (excluding ChargingArea) have a parkingCapacity > 0.
7.	All ChargingAreas have a chargingCapacity > 0, but the parkingCapacity can
	also be 0.
7.	CarState = InUse implies that a Car can't be in a Parking/ChargingArea. 
LO TOGLIEREI COME REQUISITO, UN TIZIO PUO' STARE FERMO NELLA PARKING AREA E COMUNQUE CI PAGA. IN PIU' SE QUESTO HA APPENA PRESO LA MACCHINA DA UNA PARKING AREA SICURO STA NELLA PARKING AREA PER QUALCHE SECONDO PER USCIRNE
8.	The company has at least 1 ChargingArea (eitherwise we can't have discount
	and so on) and at least 1 Car.
