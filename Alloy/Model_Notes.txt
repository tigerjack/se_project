0.	ChargingArea extends ParkingArea!! (in Alloy, it means CA is a subset of PA)
1.	All Int are fake (to say so) bcz when we run the model we generates only a
	small amount of integers. However, this model is consistent.	
2.	Id codes and emails are not relevant for our Alloy model
3.	Not interested in Plugs or Socket type bcz we assume only one kind of 
	Plug/Socket connector.
4.	ChargingCars and ParkedCars are two disjoint sets. It implies, among other 
	things, that the ParkingCapacity is not necessarily greater than 
	ChargingCapacity.
5.	
  	
// Trasversal assumptions
1.	A car may be minor damaged but still available (the  employee has manually 
	set the status to available again) ??
2.	Minutes are rounded up (if a user has driven for 30 seconds it gets rounded
	up to 1 minute) 
3.	We have one kind of Plug and one kind of Socket.
4.	There is one parking area or charging area at a given address
5.	Cars in a Parking Area can be Available, Reserved or Unavailable.
	Cars in a Charging Area can also be Plugged.
6.	All ParkingArea (including All ChargingAreas have a chargingCapacity > 0.
7.	CarState = InUse implies that a Car can't be in a Parking/Charging Area.
